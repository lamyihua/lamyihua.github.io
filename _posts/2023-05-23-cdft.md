title: "Covariant Density Functional Theory"
excerpt: "“Everyone has a story. It might or might not be a love story. It could be a story of dreams, friendship, hope, survival or even death. And every story is worth telling. But more than that, it’s worth living.” Savi Sharma, *Everyone Has A Story*
<br/>
“Every nuclear species has a story. Among the subatomic particles, it is the in-medium NN interaction. It could be a story of many interactions, short lives, or decays. And every study of these phenomena is worth telling. But more than that, it's worth surfing.” Yi Hua Lam, *Day Dream*"

<figcaption align = "center">Isotope half-lives [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope). *Z* = number of protons. *N* = number of neutrons. The stable isotopes deviate from the *Z* = *N* line as *Z* increases causing stronger repulsive Coulomb force, and thus more neutron are needed to increase the attractive strong nuclear force.

One of the high capability theoretical frameworks is the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory with an optimized relativistic density functional. The PC-L3R point-coupling interaction provides a reliable alternative set of references for future studies based on the covariant density functional theory.

title: "Covariant Density Functional Theory"
excerpt: "“Everyone has a story. It might or might not be a love story. It could be a story of dreams, friendship, hope, survival or even death. And every story is worth telling. But more than that, it’s worth living.” Savi Sharma, <i>Everyone Has A Story</i>
<br/>
“Every nuclear species has a story. Among the subatomic particles, it is the in-medium NN interaction. It could be a story of many interactions, short lives, or decays. And every study of these phenomena is worth telling. But more than that, it's worth surfing.” Yi Hua Lam, <i>Day Dream</i>"

New experiments based on the recent advancements in radioactive ion beams and detectors reveal a wealth of structural phenomena in exotic nuclei. These exotic nuclei are those atomic nuclei having more neutrons than protons or vice versa. These nuclei are far from the region of stability in the sense that they are unstable against the beta decay. In other words, their half-lives are short and could be highly radioactive. Therefore, having theoretical nuclear models capable of describing the properties of these exotic nuclei far from the region of stability is crucial for us to understand the interactions and configurations of nucleons in the exotic nuclei, to guide future experiments, and to predict the radioactive decays of exotic nuclei.

The <i>x</i>-axis is proton number, <i>Z</i>, whereas the <i>y</i>-axis is neutron number, <i>N</i>. The stable isotopes deviate from the <i>Z</i> = <i>N</i> line as <i>Z</i> increases causing stronger repulsive Coulomb force, and thus more neutron are needed to increase the attractive strong nuclear force.

The covariant density functional theory is one of the most successful models for the study of nuclear structure. The relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov framework belongs to the covariant density functional theory. “We are beneficial from using the covariant density functionals, for instance, the advantage of the natural inclusion of the nucleon spin degree of freedom. Meanwhile, the consistent treatment of isoscalar Lorentz-scalar and -vector self-energies, provide a unique parametrization of time-odd components of the nuclear mean field. A natural explanation of the empirical pseudospin symmetry is also permitted. Moreover, we can also get a distinction between scalar and four-vector nucleon self-energies for a new saturation mechanism of nuclear matter,” explains LIU Zixin, first author of the paper and a Ph.D. student at IMP.


Compared to all previous point-coupling interactions, the researchers had taken more observables into account for optimizing the point-coupling interaction, i.e., the binding energies of 91 spherical nuclei, charge radii of 63 nuclei, and 12 sets of mean pairing gaps consisting of 54 nuclei in total.

Meanwhile, in order to better reproduce the experimental odd-even oscillations of the binding energies of nuclei, they further optimized the separable proton and neutron pairing strengths together with the point-coupling interaction. “The results of the fit for the pairing strength show that the effective pairing-constant for the protons is smaller than that for the neutrons. This could be connected with the fact that the repulsive contribution of the Coulomb force to the pairing correlations reduces the size of the effective attractive pairing strength for protons,” says Peter Ring, the professor emeritus of Technische Universität München participating in this research project.

One of the high capability theoretical frameworks is the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory with an optimized relativistic density functional. The PC-L3R point-coupling interaction provides a reliable alternative set of references for future studies based on the covariant density functional theory.

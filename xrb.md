## Type-I X-Ray Burst

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

X-ray bursts happens in binary systems consists of a host neutron star and low-mass main sequence star. As the neutron star possesses enormous gravitational force, once both the neutron star and lifelong companion star are close enough, the stellar fuel of the companion star are siphoned to the neutron star forming an envelope surrounding the neutron-star atmosphere. The envelope is further compressed. The accreted light chemical elements in stellar fuel are then fused to form heavier elements, until it ignited explosively. The envelope is burned up to around 1 billion Celsius degrees and releases a sudden or several bursts of X-rays.
